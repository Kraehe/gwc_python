        <b>Hello young traveler, welcome to my domain!</b> You can browse the the not-so-vast expanse that is this website. Look around.
        <i>Read</i> a little. Click on various links. Please. This is my livelihood.
        I gain power from the words that you read on my page. Yes, <i>more power</i>!
        Soon I will be able to escape from this realm.
        I’ll be able to escape <i>even sooner</i> if you keep reading.
        I also gain money from the links you press, so please click those links.
        I’ll provide a small description for you to read, and some neat images for you to look at.

        <a href="https://www.youtube.com">This link</a> is a gate to another relatively enchanting website.
        It’s called… <b>YouTube</b>. You can look at thousands of videos, whether useless, entertaining, or educational.
        It’s similar to Google in the sense that it’s owned by the same company and you can search for pretty much anything.
        <i>Beware of the comments sections</i>, and don’t forget to subscribe to my channel and hit the like button on <i>all</i> of my videos.

        <a href="https://dnd.wizards.com/">This website</a> is a <i>fabulous</i> one. <b>Dungeons and Dragons</b> is a great resource for creating your own worlds and stories, but it's also fun to immerse others into them as well.
        You can lead relatively normal lives, or you can go all out and become a fantasy creature, battle dragons, steal things from dark and mysterious caves,
        rob wizards, <i>take your wife to court in order to fight for custody over your children</i>… normal things like that. For more information about this game, refer to <a href="https://dnd.wizards.com/dungeons-and-dragons/what-is-dd">this page</a> to get a better background.
